// (outer_wall_filament_id/inner_wall_filament_id/sparse_infill_filament_id/
// internal_solid_filament_id/top_surface_filament_id/bottom_surface_filament_id), not the more
// general "extruder" key the desktop GUI's own per-object "Set extruder" writes - see the .cpp's
// own comment on why: this vendored engine's DynamicPrintConfig::normalize_fdm(), the real
// function that would normally translate "extruder" into those six keys, is commented out in its
// own PrintApply.cpp, confirmed by reading it directly, not assumed. This alone is not sufficient
// for a real multi-tool slice, only necessary: the caller's config_overrides must also give the
// target profile a real N-filament-slot config (filament_diameter's own array length is what
// libslic3r actually uses to compute how many extruders exist - PrintApply.cpp's own `size_t
// num_extruders = m_config.filament_diameter.size()` - not machine.json's nozzle_diameter/
// extruder_colour, which only bound how many *could* exist), or every filament id here gets
// silently clamped back down to 1 (PrintObject.cpp's own clamp_feature_filament_to_valid).
// Empirically verified end to end against the real Snapmaker U1 bundled profile - see
// ToolAssignmentSlicingDeviceTest's own header comment for the real config_overrides recipe that
// produces genuine, distinct Tx tool-change commands in the sliced G-code.
//

// painted areas whose state is one, then print by PrusaSlicer's layer cycle. Only an engine built with PrusaSlicer's
